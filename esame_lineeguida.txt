Guidelines task by task

Data understanding
Data semantics
Distribution of the variables and statistics
Assessing data quality (missing values, outliers)
Variables transformations 
Pairwise correlations and eventual elimination of redundant variables 

Clustering
Clustering Analysis by K-means
Choice of attributes and distance function
Identification of the best value of k 
Characterization of the obtained clusters by using both analysis of the k centroids and comparison of the distribution of variables within the clusters and that in the whole dataset
Analysis by density-based clustering
Choice of attributes and distance function 
Study of the clustering parameters
Characterization and interpretation of the obtained clusters
Analysis by hierarchical clustering
Choice of attributes and distance function
Show and discuss different dendograms using different algorithms
Final evaluation of the best clustering approach and comparison of the clustering obtained

Classification
Learning of different decision trees with different hyper-parameters with the object of maximizing the performances
Decision trees interpretation, validation with test and training set
Training of different KNN classifiers with different parameters with the object of maximizing the performances
